Battleships
===========

###Battleships is a game where each player places a number of ships on a board. The board is a 10x10 two dimensional grid.

In a team of 4 (pairing) create a playable version of battleships. 

- Initialise a board with a Player 
- Populate it with a random arrangment of ships. 
- Players (initialised with a board) can shoot at an opponent's board, and the board can register those shots. 
- It can generate the player's view and the opponent's view (ie only the results of the shots they've made). 
- A Player knows when it's been beaten.
